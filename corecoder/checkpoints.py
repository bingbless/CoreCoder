"""Session-scoped undo for file mutations.

edit_file and write_file record a checkpoint before touching a file; /undo
pops the latest one and restores the previous bytes (or removes the file if
it did not exist). The stack persists to ~/.corecoder/checkpoints.json so
/undo still reaches back into earlier sessions after a restart. Bash side
effects are not tracked, only the two file-writing tools.
