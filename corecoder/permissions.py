"""User consent for tool calls, distilled from Claude Code's permissions.

The tools split in two. Read-only ones (read_file, glob, grep, todo_write, now, fetch_url)
run the moment the model asks; the mutating ones (edit_file, write_file,
bash, and spawning a sub-agent) stop for a yes first. "Always allow" is
remembered per tool, and the REPL passes a persist_path so the grant also
survives restarts via ~/.corecoder/permissions.json. Per tool rather than
per command, because one approved bash prefix says nothing about the next
command anyway.

When there is nobody to ask (one-shot -p mode, or a library embedding with
no callback), a mutating call is refused instead of blocking on input that
can never arrive. The refusal travels back as an ordinary tool result, so
the loop survives and the model can route around it.
